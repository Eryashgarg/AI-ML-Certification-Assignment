# AI & ML Certification: Building Intelligent Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my AI & ML certification project repository! This project focuses on building intelligent solutions using Python and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Throughout the project, I explored the latest techniques and methodologies in AI and ML, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 

## Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

- `data_preprocessing`: This directory contains the code and documentation for data preprocessing tasks like data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering.

- `model_training`: This directory contains the code and documentation for model training tasks like selecting appropriate models, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.

- `model_evaluation`: This directory contains the code and documentation for model evaluation tasks like calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- `chatbot`: This directory contains the code and documentation for building an intelligent chatbot that can answer questions about a given topic using natural language processing techniques and a pre-trained language model.

## Usage

Feel free to clone or fork this repository if you're interested in exploring AI and ML or want to use it as a reference for your own projects. Each directory contains its own README file with detailed explanations of the code and the methodology used.

## Conclusion

Thank you for checking out my work! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
